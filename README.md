# Snake Game
## Made by Ryan Medlyn for CS5410 at Utah State University

A collection static files that implement a basic snake game using HTML5 Canvas and ES6.
Also uses CSS3 variables and flex box.

There may be some unused code that needs cleaned up. I'll get to that when I find some spare time.
Maybe I'll even do a graphics overhaul and make it look prety.
